This error occurs when using a state variable within a function that is not directly part of a functional component's rendering logic.  For instance, if you have a function that updates a state variable but is called from an event handler (like `onPress`) outside of the `useEffect` hook or the component's main rendering function, React may not re-render the component to reflect the state change, leading to unexpected behavior. This usually happens when you directly modify the state variable with the spread operator without using the `setState` function.
